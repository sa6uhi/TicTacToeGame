# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple console-based application built in Kotlin. This project allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 board. Players take turns entering their moves, and the game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.

## How It Works

- **Game Board**: The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid where each cell can be empty or occupied by either an 'X' or an 'O'.
- **Gameplay**: Players alternate turns, entering their desired coordinates (row and column) to place their mark on the board. The game validates input and checks if the selected cell is available.
- **Winning Conditions**: The game checks for winning conditions after each move, determining if either player has won or if the game has ended in a draw.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sa6uhi/TicTacToeGame
    cd TicTacToeGame
    ```

2. **Run the Application**: 
   - You can run the application using your preferred Kotlin-compatible IDE or by using the Kotlin command line tools. 
   - Simply execute the main function to start the game.

3. **Play the Game**: 
   - Once the game starts, follow the prompts to enter your moves in the format "row column". For example, entering "1 1" will place your mark in the top-left cell of the board.

## Future Development

This project is open for future development and enhancements. Ideas for improvements include:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more engaging experience.
- Implementing AI to play against the computer.
- Expanding to support larger boards or different game modes.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: For building the application logic.
- **Console I/O**: For interacting with players through the console.
